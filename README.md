# Challenge 9 Project

## Description
This project was created as a tool to generate a README.md file in a more efficient manner, using Node.js. This project was a great learning experience that took a deeper dive into the ins and outs of Node, in addition to Javascript. One skill I had to focus on was the use of Inquirer to create prompts in the command line, which I found I enjoyed using. One struggle I had was figuring out how to use the functions in the generateMarkdown.js file in tandem with the index.js file. I can see the time-saving benefits of being able to fully create and edit files simply by answering prompts in the command line once the code is written.
