# Challenge 9, Create README.md Using Node

## Description
This project was created as a tool to generate a README.md file in a more efficient manner using Node. This project was a great learning experience that took a deeper dive into the ins and outs of Node, in addition to Javascript. One skill I had to focus on was the use of Inquirer to create prompts in the command line, which I found I enjoyed using. I can see the time-saving benefits of being able to fully create and edit files simply by answering prompts in the command line once the code is written.
